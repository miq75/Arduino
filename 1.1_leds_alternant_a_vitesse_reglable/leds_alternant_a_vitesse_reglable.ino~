// Pin 13 has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int red = 13;
int green = 12;

int in = A5;
int val;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(red, OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(green, OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(in, INPUT); 
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  val = analogRead(in);
  
  digitalWrite(red, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(green, LOW);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(val*2);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(red, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(green, HIGH);
  delay(val*2);               // wait for a second
